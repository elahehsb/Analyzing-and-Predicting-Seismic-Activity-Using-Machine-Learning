# Analyzing-and-Predicting-Seismic-Activity-Using-Machine-Learning

### Overview
This project aims to analyze seismic data to predict future earthquakes and understand seismic patterns using historical earthquake data and various geological datasets. The project involves collecting, processing, and analyzing large-scale seismic data, developing machine learning models for earthquake prediction, and visualizing the results through an interactive web application. This project will aid in improving earthquake preparedness and potentially mitigating the impact of future seismic events.

### System Architecture
Components:

###### Data Collection: Gather seismic data from public repositories such as USGS (United States Geological Survey).
###### Data Storage: Use PostgreSQL for storing and managing data.
###### Data Processing: Utilize Pandas and NumPy for data cleaning and preprocessing.
###### Machine Learning: Develop a machine learning model to predict seismic activity.
###### Visualization: Create an interactive web application for data visualization and result interpretation.
###### Deployment: Employ Docker for containerization and Kubernetes for orchestration.
